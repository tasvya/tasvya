        <p class="about-intro">
            Tasvya was born from a deep admiration for refined fabrics, graceful silhouettes, and the quiet power of timeless elegance.

            <p>
                We believe every child deserves to feel extraordinary during life’s most cherished celebrations — birthdays, weddings, festive gatherings, and the moments that become lifelong memories.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each creation is thoughtfully designed with meticulous attention to detail, structure, and comfort — where classic charm meets modern sophistication.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our collections are curated with intention, crafted in limited quantities, and designed to be treasured — not simply worn and set aside.
            </p>

            <p>Designed with heart. Made for moments that matter.</p>
